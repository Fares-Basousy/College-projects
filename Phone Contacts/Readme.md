# Phone Contacts app
A  first-year college project to make a Phone contacts app in C language using advanced data structures and dynamically allocated Linked list
it has the following features
* Add phone contact
* Edit an existing Contact
* Display a certain contact
* Delete a certain contact
##Update
if user deletes all contacts the app would crash because there's no structure (list head/tail) to point to
but this bug is fixed with a check if the a list is Null
